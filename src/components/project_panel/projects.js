Imagine the nasty surprise customers would get when they walk into the business and learn that the actual quote for grooming is different than what they heard on the phone. \n\n The owners of the business tried their best at mitigating this issue over the phone, but mistakes do tend to slip by. \n\n  And this have resulted to losing trust of some long time customers.\n\n To help resolve their situation, I worked the owners to modernize their website to be fun, engaging and more interactive.\n\n Most importantly, it was configured to serve as a guide for customers to make it easy for them to identify their own dog's breed, weight and size. \n\nThus, on phone calls about quotes, customers can refer to this guide to accurately describe their dogs for the grooming session.\n\n Thus, with this accurate reporting, Moochi Dog Salon saw two remarkable improvements to their business.The employees are more likely to provide an accurate quote for grooming and a lot of time was saved by avoiding the need to interrogate the customers about all the necessary details about their dog.\n\n After working with them, Moochi Dog Salon has been providing a very smooth customer experience.",
