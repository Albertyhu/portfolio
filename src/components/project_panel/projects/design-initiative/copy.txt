Multilayer parallax. 

I wanted to captivate the visitorâ€™s attention and make a remarkable impression. What better way to do that than to create a multilayer parallax hero image. 
The image is made up of multiple layers and makes use of perspective to create a 3-dimensional effect when the user scrolls down the page. 
I worked with a graphic designer to create the visuals and to create each layer of the image. 
It took over a month just to get the multi-layered parallax image to work and look right. I put a lot of effort to make sure that the image worked in most screen sizes.
